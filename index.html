    <h1>Hi, my name is Shaunessey</h1>
      <h2>What is your hobby?</h2>
        <p>I like to play TTRPGs virtually with my friends.</p>
        <h3>What's a TTRPG?</h3>
          <p>Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs) are traditionally roleplay-driven tabletop games where a group of adventurers are thrown into a fantasy world created by a Game Master. Dungeons and Dragons is the most common, which is a fantasy setting, which gained popular recognition relatively recently. I also play Shadowrun, which is a fantasy/cyberpunk hybrid. My friends and I use programs that allow us to play virtually across different time zones, or even different continents, if we need to.</p>
        <h3>How do you do that virtually?</h3>
          <p>Ever since 2020, I've been running D&D and Shadowrun virtually with the help of Steam, TaleSpire, HeroForge, and Discord. TaleSpire is a Virtual Tabletop, which is a program that allows me as a Game Master to create a 3-D map that my friends can join online. The program is hosted on Steam, which allows for easy updates and client authorization, and communication is handled with Discord, which is a VoIP telecommunication platform. Talespire also has a collaboration with HeroForge, which allows for imports of virtual minis, so my friends can bring their character's minis to the virtual Tabletop.</p>
        <h3>TaleSpire</h3>
          <p>Here's a screenshot of a scene in TaleSpire. This is from a solo campaign that follows the adventures of Jasker, a Necromancer who seeks revenge against a Lovecraftian Elder God. TaleSpire doesn't handle systems, but it allows me to create elaborate scenes and maps that my friends can join and explore.</p>

		<h3>HeroForge</h3>
          <p>HeroForge is extremely valuable because it allows my friends to have their characters represented in TaleSpire and it allows me, as the Game Master, to have unique enemies accurately represented as well. Here's a HeroForge portrait of Jasker the Necromancer, who was shown in the earlier screenshot. Virtual minis are created in HeroForge and then imported into TaleSpire where they can be moved around like virtual plastic minis.</p>

		<h3>Discord</h3>
          <p>Discord is an excellent tool for communication. It easily and reliably creates a place for everyone to commnicate, just like we were all in the same room together. It also allows me as a Game Master to share inforamtion, such as loot that the party finds, or XP gained, or specific words that were said by NPCs.</p>
